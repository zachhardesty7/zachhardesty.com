This website dramatically improves on my first website back when I thought DreamWeaver was a good idea.",

    description:

This project solves that issue by creating a widget that enables a customizable and dynamic iFrame to be embedded in any website. It can track and report various metrics (including referrers' URL or ID) back to the host's WooCommerce plugin and stores it in the order data upon completion of a sale. (Project is not currently publicly accessible but a demo can be viewed)",

Advanced enables customization of all attributes such as size and category of products to include. Custom serves as a middle ground between the two. (Project is not currently publicly accessible)",

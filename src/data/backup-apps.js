Upon completion, it would have served as the back-end of an investment firm for various cryptocurrencies. The philosophy of the company: crypto will eventually reach widespread adoption and now is the time to get in on the ground floor. Written in Python and using MongoDB, the back-end stored user information, trades, and deposits and withdrawals. It served this information to the front-end dashboard through a private API. I abandoned the project when the scope of the project became overwhelming and the crypto market crashed.",

    title: "WooCommerce Widget",
    description:
      "After extensive research, I concluded that allowing affiliates or vendors to embed products from a WooCommerce store is nigh impossible. This project solves that issue by creating a widget that enables a customizable and dynamic iFrame to be embedded in any WordPress website. It can track and report various metrics (including referrers’ URL or ID) back to the host’s WooCommerce plugin and stores it in the order data upon completion of a sale. The project is not currently publicly accessible, but a demo can be viewed.",

Express mode enables only affiliate tracking while locking the other values to their dynamic setting. Advanced mode enables customization of all attributes, such as size and category of products to include. Custom serves as a middle ground between the two. The project is not currently publicly accessible.",

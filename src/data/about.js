    "First, allow me to tell you my story. I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science and an Entrepreneurship minor at the University of Texas at Austin in 2020, but my journey began much earlier. From a young age, understanding the “why” and the “how” of everything from common items to modern marvels fascinated me. Naturally, once I received my parents’ old computer, I began tinkering and familiarizing myself. Learning to program daunted me, but I hesitantly began exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. After getting a job with my neighbor, I started tinkering around in WordPress. There, I uncovered my fascination with web development and the rest is history.",

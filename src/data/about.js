    "First, let me tell you my story. I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at the University of Texas at Austin in 2020, but my journey began much earlier. From a young age, understanding the “why” and “how” of everything from common items to modern marvels fascinated me. Naturally, once I received my parents’ old computer, I started tinkering. While learning to code daunted me, I began exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. In highschool, I got a job with my neighbor working on WordPress sites. There, I uncovered my passion for web development and the rest is history.",
